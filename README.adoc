Download https://github.com/musketyr/lusk/releases/latest[the latest application binary from the releases] and execute it against Micronaut
or Spring Boot Web project directory.

```

By default, 1000 new singletons (services) and 1000 controllers will be generated into the project accompanied with `HttpSpec.groovy`
specification to load test the running application.
